-- The round announcer as each TF2 client plays it. The timer's countdown is
-- CTeamRoundTimer::ClientThink (teamplay_round_timer.cpp): "Mission begins
-- in 60 seconds" ... "1" through setup, "Mission ends in ..." through normal
-- time, and the siren when setup gives way to the round. Only the timer shown
-- in the HUD speaks, and only while it runs with auto_countdown on. Overtime
-- is CTFGameRules::HandleOvertimeBegin. Win, loss, stalemate and sudden death
-- music arrive from the server as tf2.sound.
